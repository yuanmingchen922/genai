This concept allows us to **generate new text** that is stylistically and contextually similar to the original.\n","\n","To achieve the most realistic generation, the **probability of the next word** should ideally depend on **all of the preceding text.** However, calculating this is **computationally infeasible** for large documents.\n","\n","To simplify this, we make an assumption: the probability of the next word **depends only on a fixed number of preceding words**, known as the **context.** Recall that, more generally, text is usually broken up into elements called **tokens** (in modern language models these contain only parts of the word), but to keep things relatively simple we will initially work with one-word tokens.\n","\n","In the simplest case, we assume the next word depends only on the **immediately preceding word.** This is an example of a **Markov Assumption** and uses **bigram probabilities** to **generate random text** starting from a given word by sequentially sampling the next word based on its bigram probability.\n","\n","We will also **visualize the bigram probabilities** using a **matrix format**, where each row represents the current word and each column shows the probability of the next word.\n","\n","It will form a **baseline NLP model** that we will **deploy** as part of this module's class activity.\n","As we learn more advanced techniques, we'll **update the model** to improve its performance and capabilities."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"vblA","metadata":{"marimo":{"config":{"hide_code":true}},"id":"vblA"},"source":["## Bigram Probabilities\n","\n","How should the bigram probabilities be modeled?

MLE is a method of estimating the parameters of a statistical model by maximizing the likelihood function, which measures how well the model explains the observed data.\n","\n","Probability of a word sequence $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$ can be expressed as:\n","\n","$$\n","p(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n) = p(w_1) p(w_2 | w_1) p(w_3 | w_1, w_2) \\cdots p(w_n | w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_{n-1})\n","$$\n","\n","Using the Markov bigram assumption, this simplifies to:\n","\n","$$\n","p(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n) = p(w_1) p(w_2 | w_1) p(w_3 | w_2) \\cdots p(w_n | w_{n-1})\n","$$\n","\n","An MLE estimator for the bigram probabilities corresponds to **modeling** the probability distribution $p$ in such a way that if $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$ are the observed words in the training data, the probability above is maximized.\n","\n","Indeed, it can be shown that the MLE estimator for the bigram probabilities is given by the bigram count formula above, which is repeated below for convenience:\n","\n","$$p(w_2 | w_1) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2)}{C(w_1)}.$$\n","\n","This formula is used in the `analyze_bigrams` function below.
